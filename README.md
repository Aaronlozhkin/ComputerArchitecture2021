All code is written in C and must be compiled using the MakeFile. Code requiring text files have samples. 

Rutgers New Brunswick Computer Architecture 2021 Course and Project Work. Not to be used in any way as submission for an asignment! 

**rle:**

Simple string compressor that enumerates any duplicate letters within an input string. Only prints if the compressed string will be smaller. 

**list:**

Builds a linked list based on user input. Commands printed on run. Supports unique insertion with no duplicates along with deletion.

**Binary Search Tree:**

Builds a binary search tree based on user input. Commands printed on run. Supports insertion, deletion, search, and in-order-print.

**mexp:**

Takes a file as input with an nxn matrix. Performs any amount of multiplication operations (m >= 0).

**Housing Predictions:**

This program implements a simple linear regression, training a model to predict housing price based on several variabels from bedrooms to square footage. Involves transposing, inverting, and multiplying matrices.

**Cache Simulator:**

Simulates and counts cache hits and misses of various types of cache systems with and without prefetching. Capable of Fully-Associative, Direct, and n-Way-Associative systems along with choices on First-In-First-Out or Least-Recently-Used replacement method. Block and Cache Size are taken as inputs. Tested up to 5.8 million reads/writes.
